  <p><span class="style5">Optimization Services (OS) is an open-source project under COIN-OR and provides infrastructure for the solution of optimization problems over the internet. This includes a number of XML schemas for the transmission of problem instances, options and solutions as well as related information; and interfaces to a number of open-source and commercial solvers. This talk presents recent developments, such as support for the description of matrices within the OSiL format, an interface to the open-source SDP solver CSDP, and schema elements to describe real-time data elements, problem modifications, disjunctions, and stochastic information. </span></p>

  <p><span class="style5">A lot of attention has been given recently to cone programming and matrix programming, using, for instance, relaxations of hard mixed integer programs using variables whose values are required to form symmetric positive semidefinite matrices or satisfy similar cone constraints. This talk presents efforts to facilitate the formulation of such problems within the OSiL framework, an XML schema used to allow a unified representation format for a large variety of mathematical optimization problem instances. OSiL is part of the OS project, an open source project under the COIN-OR umbrella.

  <p><span class="style5">Optimization Services (OS) is a web-aware framework linking algebraic modeling languages and solvers. Communication takes place in standardized XML formats. After a brief overview of the system design I will describe the option and result formats in more detail. Unlike the instance description, there are choices here to allow for both flexibility to cater to the varying design choices of solver developers, and rigidity to allow one AML to talk to multiple solvers without changing the interface. </span></p>

  <p><span class="style5">Over the 10 years of its existence, the original OSI interface has grown--unlike most of its users--from 'just a little pudgy' to 'seriously overweight'. OSI2 is a return to something a bit more lean and mean, with outsourcing. In this talk we will discuss the implementation of an interface layer whose primary function is to act as a broker, managing modules provided by underlying solvers to implement defined APIs.  </span></p>

  <p><span class="style5">We consider the problem of constructing optimal bus routes. The objective is to minimize the distance traveled weighted by the number of riders on the route. The resulting model is a non-convex integer program that is extremely difficult to optimize. We show how to reformulate this problem as a linear integer program in an extended variable space. The resulting formulation is very large and we describe a column generation algorithm based on COIN-OR software. </span></p>

  <p><a name="OSOLOSRLOPTIMIZATIONDAYS2011" id="OSOLOSRLOPTIMIZATIONDAYS2011"></a>Horand Gassman (presenter), Jun Ma, Kipp Martin, Optimization Services: Communicating Solver Options and Solver Results (05/03/2011)<strong> </strong><a href="publications/OSoL-OSrL_OptimizationDay2011.pdf"><strong>pdf</strong></a></p>
  <p><span class="style5">Optimization Services (OS) is a framework that links algebraic modelling languages (AMLs) and solvers, developed as an open source project under the umbrella of COIN-OR. OS supports a variety of linear and nonlinear solvers, both open source and commercial. OS is web-aware, allowing for seemless integration of distributed computing environments and even cloud computing. Communication between algebraic modelling languages and solvers takes place through strings and files in standardized XML formats. I will give a brief overview of the system design and will then concentrate on describing the option and result formats in more detail. Unlike the instance description, there are challenges here to allow for both flexibility to cater to the varying design choices of solver developers, and rigidity to allow one AML to talk to multiple solvers without changing the interface. </span></p>

  <p><span class="style5">In this talk we describe how to use the Optimization Services (OS) project to interface with COIN-OR solvers. The OS interface is quite flexible and allows the user to generate linear and nonlinear instances for solvers. In addition, there is an interface for solver options and solver results. </span></p>

  <p><span class="style5">We present the extension of COIN OS to model cone optimization problems. We discuss the design principles of the extension. In the end we are able to model problems with matrices, thus extendeing the general modelling capabilities of COIN OS. This is joint work with Kipp Martin, Horand Gassmann and Jun Ma.</span></p>

  <p><a name="OSCONE-INFORMS2009" id="OSCONE-INFORMS2009"></a>Horand Gassman , Jun Ma, Imre P&oacute;lik (presenter), Kipp Martin, Modeling Cone Optimization Problems with COIN OS (10/12/2009)<strong> </strong><a href="publications/polik_ConeOSiLinforms2009_sandiego.pdf"><strong>pdf</strong></a></p>
  <p><span class="style5">We present a new modelling extension of the popular COIN OS, to model  cone optimization problems. Not only this extension is able to  represent a wide range of optimization problems, but it can also  capture the special structure of them. This is crucial, since it  enables the solvers to exploit these special structures to speed up the  computation or to improve accuracy.</span></p>

  <p><span class="style5">The Bearcat Transportation System of the University of Cincinnati is  modeled and solved as a multiple vehicle routing problem. The Student  population and travel time data coupled with client driven constraints  are used to design the transportation system. The COIN-OR solver CBC is  used in a GAMS environment to solve the problem. Results indicate the  solutions are effective and implementable.</span></p>

  <p><span class="style5">Datalog is a deductive language tailored for easy database access. We present an algebraic modeling language in Datalog for mixed-integer linear optimization models. Using this language, data can be easily queried from a database and combined with models to produce problem instances, providing an advantage over conventional optimization modeling languages that rely on reading data by use of builtin tools or importing data from external sources via standard files. The declarative nature of Datalog permits the underlying syntax to be kept reasonably intuitive and simple.</span></p>

We will review how multiple columns of a sparse Hessian can be computed with the same work as one column. CppAD uses the greedy distance two graph coloring algorithm to group columns that can be computed together. We will review this algorithm and some speed tests of the sparse Hessian calculation.

  <p class="style5">Software-as-a-service is radically changing the traditional software model. Companies 
    are experiencing tremendous savings by using enterprise application software on an 
    as-needed basis rather than purchasing and installing the software. There is no reason why<br>
    optimization should not be available as a software service. Optimization Services (OS) is a 
    project designed to make access to powerful optimization solvers as simple and ubiquitous 
    as access to a network connection or electricity. 
    In order to make optimization-as-service work, it is necessary to have a robust service 
    oriented architecture (SOA) to link all parts of the system, including modeling languages, 
    solvers, schedulers, and data repositories. This is especially true when the modeling language 
    software, solver software, and data used to generate a model instance reside on<br>
    different machines, in different geographical locations, and use different operating systems. 
    In this talk we describe protocols that we are developing to 1) represent optimization problem 
    instances, problem solutions, and solver options; 2) facilitate communication between 
    solvers and clients that use the solvers; and 3) allow clients that use optimization solvers 
    to discover their existence over the network. We demonstrate a working implementation<br>
    of these protocols and show how to use free, open-source solvers as a service.</p>

  <p class="style5">We present a restructuring of the computations in Lenstra's methods for  solving mixed integer linear programs. A concept of Adjoint lattices is  introduced and used for this purpose. This allows us to develop  branching on hyperplane algorithms in the space of original variables,  without requiring any dimension reduction for pure or mixed integer  programs. Reduced lattice basis are also computed in the space of  original variables. Based on these results we give a new natural  heuristic way of generating branching hyperplanes, and discuss its  relationship with recent reformulation techniques of Aardal and  Lenstra. We show that the reduced basis available at the root node has  useful information on the branching hyperplanes for the generalized  branch-and-bound tree. Our development allows us to give algorithms for  mixed convex integer programs with properties similar to those for the  mixed integer linear programs. Implementation of this algorithm in a  prototype software system "IMPACT" is described. Computational results  are presented on difficult knapsack and market split problems using  this approach.</p>

  <p class="style5">Distributed computing technologies such as Web Services are growing rapidly in importance in today&rsquo;s computing environment. In the area of mathematical optimization, it is becoming increasingly common to separate modeling languages, client GUI environments and systems from optimization solvers and other algorithmic codes. In fact, the modeling language software, solver software, and data used to generate the model instance might reside on different machines using different operating systems. Such a distributed environment makes it critical to have an open standard for exchanging model instances. In this talk I present OSiL (Optimization Services Instance Language), an XML Schema for representing general mathematical optimization instances including general nonlinear, programming, network programming, quadratic programming, user-defined functions, black box non-closed form simulations, and constraint logic programming. For those of you who are familiar with MPS format for linear programming, think of OSiL as a more general and powerful representation. Since the Optimization Services instance Language is part of a much broader general framework for optimization modeling systems using Optimization Services (OS), the talk will start with a brief 10-15 minute introduction of the Optimization Services Framework to provide a better picture of the context for the OSiL Language. The Optimization Services Framework is presented in an earlier talk at the department and will show up in most of the talks in the series. Due to the one-hour limit, I will concentrate on the linear part of the OSiL and how it can easily be extended to more general optimization types. The linear part of OsiL originates from a pure linear programming format called LPFML by Fourer, Lopez, and Martin. In a possible later talk, I will give detailed extension to quadratic programming, optimization over black box simulation, constraint logic programming etc. and the library and open source API that help to read and write the OSiL instance depending on interests.  </p>

Through standardization of optimization  representation, communication, discovery, and registration, this  framework provides an open infrastructure for all modeling system  components, including modeling languages, optimization servers,  clients, interfaces, analyzers, solvers and function simulators.</p>

  <p class="style5">One way to encourage modeling language and solver compatibility is to  use a standard representation of a problem instance. We present LPFML  Schema, a W3C Schema for representing linear programming problem  instances in XML. We describe a library of open-source C++ classes that  facilitate the exchange of information between modeling languages and  solvers. We show how these classes are used to provide  previously unavailable modeling language-solver connections. LPFML is officially subsumed into the new version, OSiL (Optimization Services instance Language) by R. Fourer, J. Ma, K. Martin.</p>
