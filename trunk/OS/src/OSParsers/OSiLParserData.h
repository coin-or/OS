/*! \class OSiLParserData
 *  \brief The OSiLParserData Class, used to store parser data.
 * 
 * @author Robert Fourer, Jun Ma, Kipp Martin
 * @version 1.0, 03/14/2004
 * @since OS 1.0
 * 
 * \remarks
 * The OSiLParserData class is used to hold the nonlinear
 * part of the problem when an OSiL instance is parsed.
 * We do this so we can have a reentrant parser. We do not
 * have to store the linear part because we do not use flex/bison
 * to parse the linear part of the problem.
