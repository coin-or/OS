The objective of Optimization Services (OS) is to provide a set of standards 
for representing optimization instances, results, solver options, and 
communication between clients and solvers in a distributed environment 
using Web Services.  This COIN-OR project provides source code for libraries 
and executable programs that implement OS standards.
