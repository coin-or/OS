The optimal objective value of the problem I sent you provides a lower bound for the cardinalities of all triangulations which contain a certain simplex of volume 8/6! and which contains thecentroid of the 6-cube in its interior.

In converting the MPS file, Jun Ma filled the RHS section in the MPS file with dummy RHS labels. DFL001, says Marc Meketon, "is a 'real-world' airline schedule planning (fleet assignment) problem.  This LP was preprocessed by a modified version of the KORBX(r) System preprocessor.  The problem reduced in size (rows, columns, non-zeros) significantly.  The row and columns were randomly sorted and renamed, and a fixed adjustment to the objective function was eliminated.  The name of the problem is derived from the initials of the person who created it."	On an IEEE-arithmetic machine (an SGI 4D/380S), David Gay succeeded in getting MINOS 5.3 to report optimal objective values, 1.1261702419E+07 and 1.1249281428E+07, for DFL001 only by starting with LOAD files derived from the solution obtained on the same machine by Bob Vanderbei's ALPO (an interior-point code); starting from one of the resulting "optimal" bases, MINOS ran 23914 iterations on a VAX before reporting an optimal value of 1.1253287141E+07.  When started from the same LOAD file used on the SGI machine, MINOS on the VAX reported an optimal value of 1.1255107696E+07.  Changing the FEASIBILITY TOLERANCE to 1.E-10 (from its default of 1.E-6) led MINOS on the SGI machine to report "optimal" values of 1.1266408461E+07 and 1.1266402835E+07.  This clearly is a problem where the FEASIBILITY TOLERANCE, initial basis, and floating-point arithmetic strongly affect the "optimal" solution that MINOS reports.  On the SGI machine, ALPO with SPLIT 3 found  	primal:  obj value =  1.126639607e+07      FEASIBLE   ( 2.79e-09 )	dual:    obj value =  1.126639604e+07      FEASIBLE   ( 1.39e-16 )		Bob Bixby reports the following about his experience solving DFL001 with CPLEX:	First, the value for the objective function that I get running defaults is 1.1266396047e+07, with the following residuals:	Max. unscaled (scaled) bound        infeas.: 4.61853e-14 (2.30926e-14)	Max. unscaled (scaled) reduced-cost infeas.: 6.40748e-08 (6.40748e-08)  	Max. unscaled (scaled) Ax-b          resid.: 4.28546e-14 (4.28546e-14)  	Max. unscaled (scaled) c_B-B'pi      resid.: 8.00937e-08 (8.00937e-08)	The L_infinity condition number of the (scaled) optimal basis is   213737.  I got exactly the same objective value solving the problem in several different ways.  I played a bit trying to get a better reduced-cost infeasibility, but that seems hopeless (if not pointless) given the c-Bpi residuals. Just as an aside, this problem exhibits very interesting behavior when solved using a simplex method.  I ran reduced-cost pricing on it in phase I, with the result that it took 465810 iterations to get feasible.  Running the default CPLEX pricing scheme, the entire problem solved in 94337 iterations (33059 in phase I) on a Sparcstation.  Steepest-edge pricing (and a different scaling) took 25803 iterations.  This is a nasty problem.</description>		<originalFileName>dfl001.mps</originalFileName>		<osDirectoty>linear/continuous/</osDirectoty>		<osFileName>dfl001.osil</osFileName>	</instance>	<instance>		<name>E226</name>		<source>Converted by Jun Ma, Kipp Martin, Huanyuan Sheng from the Netlib Repository.

It is structured, namely, its first section is a band matrix with the dominating number of nonzeros, while the second section is also a band matrix with bandwidth equals 2 and coefficients +1, -1.  The problem is a representative of a family of problems in which the number of rows andthe bandwidth of the first section can vary.  This one is a medium size problem from the family.

This large problem is the original version of the NETLIB GREENBEA problem.  The feasible NETLIB version was created by Bob Fourer by repairing the version given here.  The GREENBEA problem is network based and originates in the petrochemical industry. This problem has 111 N-type rows in the MPS file. In converting the problem, Kipp Martin used a parser that treats the first N-type row ("B...FR..") as the objective function and the rest 110 N-type row as free constraint and didn't not include them in the OSiL file.The parser also generates a dense objective coefficient section; thus the nonzero count (36288) contains all the zero value objective coefficients. In the original MPS file, there are 2504 constraints (with the 110 N-type constraint rows). The original MPS file also contains 35159 nonzeros. </description>		<originalFileName>greenbea_infeasible.mps</originalFileName>		<osDirectoty>linear/continuous/infeasible/</osDirectoty>		<osFileName>greenbea_infeasible.osil</osFileName>	</instance>	<instance>		<name>ITEST2</name>		<source>Converted by Jun Ma, Kipp Martin, Huanyuan Sheng from the infeasible problems in the Netlib Repository.

This is a medium size problem derived from a petrochemical plant model.  Doctored to generate infeasibility due to inability to meet volume or quality restrictions.  It is a highly volatile problem, yielding IISs of varying sizes when different IIS isolation algorithms are applied.
