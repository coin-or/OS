= Eclipse Refactor Notes =

== Web Services WSDL ==

Web service was created by right clicking OSSolverService and
selecting Web Services > Create Web Service.  The current Eclipse is
broken in this regards, so the files here are from earlier work as
OSSolverService should be ported to Axis2 at some point.

== Eclipse and .settings ==

Eclipse/SVN does not save the .settings directory so some aspects of
the project are lost across machines/development.
