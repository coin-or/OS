  <p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
  <H1 class="style4">Common Public License Version 1.0</H1>
  <p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC   LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM   CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. </p>
  <p><strong>1. DEFINITIONS </strong></p>
  <p>"Contribution" means:</p>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation   distributed under this Agreement, and </p>
    <p>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
    <p>i) changes to the Program, and</p>
    <p>ii) additions to the Program;</p>
    <p>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are   distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a   Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone   acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to   the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in   conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not   derivative works of the Program.</p>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. </p>
  <p>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are   necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when   combined with the Program.</p>
  <p>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this   Agreement. </p>
  <p>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,   including all Contributors. </p>
  <p><strong>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</strong></p>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to   reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,   distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such   derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p>
    <p>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants   Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed   Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the   Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.   This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the   Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such   addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations   which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</p>
    <p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses   to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any   Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual   property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to   Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of   intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the   rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.   For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to   distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license   before distributing the Program.</p>
    <p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient   copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set   forth in this Agreement.</p>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p><STRONG>3. REQUIREMENTS</STRONG> </p>
  <p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under   its own license agreement, provided that: </p>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>
    <p>b) its license agreement:</p>
    <p>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and   conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and   non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and   fitness for a particular purpose; </p>
    <p>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for   damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential   damages, such as lost profits; </p>
    <p>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered   by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and </p>
    <p>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such   Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or   through a medium customarily used for software exchange. </p>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
    <p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. </p>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within   the Program.</p>
  <p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,   if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the   originator of the Contribution. </p>
  <p><STRONG>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</STRONG> </p>
  <p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who   includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner   which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if   a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such   Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify   every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages   and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal   actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the   extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in   connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product   offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses   relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order   to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial   Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to   control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any   related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in   any such claim at its own expense. </p>
  <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product   offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that   Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties   related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such   Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the   Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other   Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court   requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial   Contributor must pay those damages. </p>
  <p><STRONG>5. NO WARRANTY</STRONG></p>
  <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON   AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS   OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,   NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each   Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and   distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of   rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of   program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,   programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. </p>
  <p><STRONG>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY </STRONG></p>
  <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY   CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,   SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST   PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,   STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY   OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS   GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>
  <p><STRONG>7. GENERAL</STRONG></p>
  <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the   remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the   parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary   to make such provision valid and enforceable. </p>
  <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect   to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a   lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient   under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In   addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program   itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)   infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under   Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
  <p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to   comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does   not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of   such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,   Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as   reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement   and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and   survive. </p>
  <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in   order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be   modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to   publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.   No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.   IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve   as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the   Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including   Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement   under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement   is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its   Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections   2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the   intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether   expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not   expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. </p>
  <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the   intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this   Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year   after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in   any resulting litigation.</p>
