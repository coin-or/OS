   * Split into Eclipse projects (OSCommon, OSServer, OSThirdParty)
   * External Java jars will be provided by OSThirdParty
     * OSThirdParty/scripts/instal-external.sh to automate unpacking downloads
   * Ported to new build envrionment
     * Dead/broken code removal
     * Convert to unix EOL
     * Commit hacks to build Tomcat6 (see todo tags)
     * Ported to Saxon-b v9
     * Use log4j for logging (console in eclipse is now clickable)
     * WSDL files generated from a previous version of eclipse
   * Initial documentation (see INSTALL.txt, doc/* and scripts/*)
