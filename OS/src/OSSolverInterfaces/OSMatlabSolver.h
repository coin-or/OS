 *  \brief The OSMatlab  Class.
 * 
 * @author Robert Fourer, Jun Ma, Kipp Martin
 * @version 1.0, 03/14/2004
 * @since OS 1.0
 * 
 * \remarks
 * the OSMatlab class is used by the matlabSolver 
 * mex (Matlab EXecutable) which takes MATLAB data
 * structures and creats an OSiL string.
 * 
 * for now we can only handle linear integer and
 * quadratic programming problems, not general
 * nonlinear problems
