	* Changes to Trunk put into Stable 2.1

	* added eror checking to OSInstance, OSOption and OSResult

	* changes to OSiL schema for easier conversion of SDPA format

	* added two versions of a small problem (SDPA1) to examples/misc folder

	* add the example OSJavaDemo.java to OS/examples/osJava -- this examples shows how to call the C++ OSSolverService
	  using Java code from branches/OSjava/OSCommon

	* applications/amplClient/OSAmplClient.cpp -- added a feature to read an option file
       in OSoL format and send it on to the solver.
	
	* applications/amplClient/OSAmplClient/OSAmplClient.cpp -- changed the solver default selection.
       If no options are specified using {\bf OSAmplClient\_options}, by default, clp is used for continuous linear models. 
	 For continuous nonlinear models ipopt is used. For mixed-integer linear models (MIP) cbc is used. 
	 For mixed-integer nonlinear models bonmin is used.  All solvers are invoked locally. 
	 
	* src/OSSolverService.cpp -- changed the solver default selection.
	 If no options are specified using {\bf OSAmplClient\_options}, by default, clp is used for continuous linear models.

	 For mixed-integer nonlinear models bonmin is used.  All solvers are invoked locally. 
	 
	* src/OSModelInterfaces/OSgams2osil.cpp(h) -- added these two files.  This allows for reading of the GAMS
	 .dat format and converting to OSiL.
	 
	* src/OSAgent/OSWSUtil.cpp -- changed the soapify() and desoapify() to allow for encasing the OSiL, OSoL, OSrL
	 files in a CDATA section to speed up processing.
	 
	* (Ticket #12) src/OSSolverInterfaces/OSIpoptSolver.cpp -- changed to report reduced costs in the result. 
	
	* (Ticket #13) src/OSSolverInterfaces/ -- changed the solver interfaces to work with either 0 variables
	 specified or an empty variables section. Also changed the OSiL parser to allow for an empty
	 variables section.
