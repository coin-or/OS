The Optimization Services (OS) Package:

The objective of Optimization Services (OS)is to provide a set of standards 
for representing optimization instances, results, solver options, and 
communication between clients and solvers in a distributed environment 
using Web Services.  This COIN-OR project provides source code for libraries 
and executable programs that implement OS standards. 

The goal of OSCommon in C++ is to create a light OS project that does not 
depend on other COIN-OR or third party libraries, except for the internally used 
CppAD project to carry out automatic differentiation. This project is light weighted
and does not have any vendor-specific code or any software that is not CPL compatible. 
By pointing OSCommon as an exteranlly dependent projects, other COIN-OR will 
also avoid potential circular dependency issues.
