\input{chapters/Future_Work.tex}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Implement a Gurobi solver interface.
%
%\item Implement the {\tt mult} and {\tt inc} features in OSiL.
%
%\item Implement the SOS feature in OSiL
%
%\item Implement a switch so that the solver output is put into OSrL output. This output should go into a {\tt solutionResult} element in {\tt otherSolutionResults.}
%
%\item Put the GAMS OSiL read and OSrL write into the OSModelingInterfaces
%
%\item Implement the Bcp solver
%
%\item Implement OS as part of CoinUtils. (That is, break out some of the basic routines.)
%
%\item Write a document on how to hook your solver to OS
%
%\item Add a module to FlopC++ that writes OSiL
%
%\item Add an OS option to the OSSolverInterfaces that allows the user to get the log file of the solver. The user would have to use the specific solver option to set the level of log output.
%
%\item Investigate the Amazon cloud computing
%
%\item Installer for Windows
%
%\item Documentation on the new Java example 
%
%\item  Building some sort of Java distribution for users who want to build OSiL from Java and call OSSolverService from Java. The demand for this may be nontrivial.  And then document this.
%
%\item  Treat \url{https://projects.coin-or.org/OS/ticket/14} 
%
%\item Figure out how to put the version number on the executables
%

%\item GAMS list -- SOS can be used with Cbc and Bonmin, semicontinuous+semiinteger
%variables with Cbc, user defined functions with Ipopt and Bonmin,
%parameters for Cbc, and - most important - you can redirect the output  ;-) .
%\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
I like the message handling of Ipopt, where you can register several
journals that can handle output for different categories with differing
print levels. For the GAMSlinks we then have a GamsJournal that is used
to direct the output into the GAMS output channels.

Cbc and Osi-interfaced solvers use CoinMessageHandler. I do not really
like them because the message handler sometimes insert spaces or
newlines which make them very inflexible about what kind of output you
can print, but we have a GamsMessageHandler that does the job. Not all
Osi links support this yet. For Clp, Cbc, DyLP it should work. For the
trunk versions of Cpx, Msk, Xpr it should also work. Symphony I don't
remember.

For Bonmin and Couenne one has to pass in both an Ipopt::Journal and a
CoinMessageHandler.
